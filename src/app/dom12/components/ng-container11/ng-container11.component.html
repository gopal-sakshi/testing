<div *ngFor = "let item of items">
    <div *ngIf="item.id">{{item.id}}&nbsp;{{item.name}}</div>
</div>
<!-- 
    we do this, because ===> inability to use multiple structural directives on a single host element in Angular 
    but it introduces several extra empty <div> in the DOM if item.id is a falsy value which might not be required.
    Not a problem for small application, but for a huge application that has a complex DOM (to display tens of thousands of data) this might become troublesome ===> as the elements might have listeners attached to them which will still be there in the DOM listening to events.
-->

<!--
    <ng-container> 
        a grouping element that doesn't interfere with styles or layout because Angular doesn't put it in the DOM.
-->

<!-- so use this instead... it wont have any extra div elements -->
<ng-container *ngFor="let item of items">
    <div *ngIf="item.id">{{item.id}}&nbsp;{{item.name}}</div>
</ng-container>
