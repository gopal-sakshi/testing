Here we have some things

# Thing 1
- parent & child12 component
    we create a child12 component... and we place this child12 component within the parent component

# Thing 2
- we have joinArray component 
    inheritance ----> joinArray --> Parent23 ---> GrandParent23
    child comp -----> then joinArray also has a child component with name child23
    child23 component ---> base-child23 class
- now we explore, which constructor gets called first...


# Thing 3
- parent34 component will send data to child component
- child34 component will modify the input bound data
- we will verify whether the change is reflected or not
