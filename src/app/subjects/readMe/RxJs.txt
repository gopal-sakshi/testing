  my current rxjs version = 6.6.0

rxjs introduced breaking changes from rxjs version 6.

SOME CHANGES
  import { Observable } from "rxjs/Observable"; -------------------> import { Observable } from "rxjs";
  import 'rxjs/add/operator/do' ------------------------> import { do } from "rxjs/operators";
  Renamed Operators
    Some operators have also been renamed due to name collisions with JavaScript reserved words. They are
    do => tap
    catch => catchError
    switch => switchAll
    finally => finalize
  No Operator Chaining
    we can't chain our operators anymore you need to use the pipe operator

    source
      .map(x => x + x)
      .mergeMap(n => of(n + 1, n + 2)
        .filter(x => x % 1 == 0)
        .scan((acc, x) => acc + x, 0)
      )
      .catch(err => of('error found'))
      .subscribe(printResult);

    source.pipe(
      map(x => x + x),
      mergeMap(n => of(n + 1, n + 2).pipe(
        filter(x => x % 1 == 0),
        scan((acc, x) => acc + x, 0),
      )),
      catchError(err => of('error found')),
    ).subscribe(printResult);
