modify the build, serve targets in angular.json
then do npm run start

"resolutions" property in package.json
- only those versions of webpack should be kept in dependency tree
- say there is a npmjs package "gopal612-js-lib" in dependency[] array of pacakge.json
    {
        "gopal612-js-lib": "1.2.0"
    }
- say "gopal612-js-lib" uses webpack 4.0.0 internally
- Author of "gopal612-js-lib" didnt release new version that updated webpack to 5.0.0
- so, instead of waiting for that author to release "gopal612-js-lib" 1.3.0
    we use "resolutions" property of package.json
- all versions of webpack in dependency tree will be 5.4.0
