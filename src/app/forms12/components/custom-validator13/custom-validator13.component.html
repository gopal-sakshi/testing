            we need to build a directive with a matching selector (meaning selector MUST also be "validateEmail")

        <!--
            a) Angular has an internal mechanism to execute validators on a form control
            b) It maintains a multi provider for a dependency token called NG_VALIDATORS
                    - Angular injects multiple values for a single token that is used for a multi provider.
            c) It turns out that all built-in validators are already added to the NG_VALIDATORS token
            d) So whenever Angular instantiates a form control and performs validation, 
                it basically injects the dependency for the NG_VALIDATORS token, which is a list of all validators, 
                and executes them one by one on that form control.
            e) Since multi providers can be extended by adding more multi providers to a token, 
                we can consider NG_VALIDATORS as a hook to add our own validators.
